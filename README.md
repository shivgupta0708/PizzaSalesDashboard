# PizzaSalesDashboard
Developed an interactive dashboard called 'Pizza Sales Report' using Power BI and SQL. The main goal was to provide the restaurant owner with insights into sales trends, top-selling pizzas, and overall performance to help them make better business decisions. What made this project unique is the two-way validation approachâ€”
I used SQL to query the data based on customer requirements and then cross-validated it with Power BI visualizations.
