# PizzaSalesDashboard
Developed an interactive dashboard called 'Pizza Sales Report' using Power BI and SQL. The main goal was to provide the restaurant owner with insights into sales trends, top-selling pizzas, and overall performance to help them make better business decisions. What made this project unique is the two-way validation approachâ€”
I used SQL to query the data based on customer requirements and then cross-validated it with Power BI visualizations.
In Power BI, I created a set of KPIs using card visuals to display key business metrics such as total revenue, total pizzas sold, average order value, and average pizzas per order. For visualizing trends, I used a column chart to show daily order trends and a line chart for monthly trends. I also added a donut chart to show the percentage of sales by pizza category and size, and a funnel chart to display total pizzas sold by category. Filters for pizza category and date allow the user to interactively control the data displayed on the entire dashboard.

Also included some text-based insights, such as identifying the busiest days for orders and the maximum sales days. This information, combined with visual insights, helped the owner recognize patterns in customer behavior. For example, they could adjust their marketing efforts or inventory based on which pizzas sold the most or which days were the busiest.

The dashboard is designed for ease of use. There are two navigation buttons that allow the user to move between two different dashboard pages. The second page shows the top and bottom 5 pizzas by revenue, quantity, and total orders. This way, the restaurant owner could quickly identify both popular and underperforming items.
